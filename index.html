                  Scott Kerr of AllMusic wrote that the band combined "the dark and youthful themes of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music." Healy specifically cites Talking Heads, My Bloody Valentine, and Michael Jackson as musical influences; he states that his greatest influence is the oeuvre of filmmaker John Hughes. For their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It, Healy cited D'Angelo, Roberta Flack, Boards of Canada and Sigur Rós as inspirations, saying that they're "a post-modern pop band that references a million things. I don't even know what my band is half the time." Their melancholic black and white visual aesthetic is juxtaposed with major keys and what the band calls "classic pop sensibilities." Critics at Pitchfork have favourably compared them to The Big Pink. Sex EP was described by Paste as "equal parts ethereal and synth pop", with "haunting" and "smooth" vocals. Their "mellow", stripped down style was praised for its lack of "attention-grabbing production theatrics."

              In 2013, Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying of the Grammy award-winning a cappella group Pentatonix started YouTube channel SUPERFRUIT, posting comedic vlogs about pop culture, fashion, Wyatt the cat, and “Weekly Obsessions." Their videos sometimes feature YouTuber collaborations on a cappella mashups of “Hip Hop Goes Broadway," “Beyoncé," and “Frozen Medley." The channel’s popularity has created a celebrity and a following for Mitch and Scott independent of Pentatonix, with close to 2 million subscribers and more than 180 million views. Their #superfruitlivestream celebration of 1 million subscribers trended #1 in the US and worldwide at the time of the broadcast.
              On October 18, 2016, the pair released an original song, "Bad 4 Us", on their channel. Later, on November 15, 2016, they released a second original song, "Sweet Life”. In 2017, they released the rest of their album “Future Friends”.

              <p>
                It's been 13 years since the Killers exploded with their debut single, "Mr. Brightside," and they're still one of the biggest rock acts in the world; the Las Vegas band just headlined Lollapalooza and has an arena tour kicking off in January. "There's still a need for what we have to offer, obviously," says frontman Brandon Flowers. "Our shows keep growing, and the tours just keep getting more fun." He sees their upcoming album, Wonderful Wonderful (overseen by veteran U2 and R.E.M. producer Jacknife Lee), as an improvement from their last one, 2012's Battle Born. "We worked on that incrementally with different producers," Flowers says. "Some of the songs I'm not so enthused about."

              <p>
                Owl City is an American electronica project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota; it is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young. Young created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the social networking site MySpace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with Universal Republic Records, now Republic Records, in 2008.
                Owl City's music is described as indietronica and synth-pop and is often described as belonging under the electronic music genre. Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of Unwed Sailor and Thomas Newman. Young also incorporates some of his Christian faith into his music, since he is a vocal Christian. Young's faith is evident on the album, "All Things Bright and Beautiful", especially in "Galaxies". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix, he said, "I feel like if I were ever to hide the fact that that's what's so important to me, it would be a crime, that I should probably be put in jail for that."
